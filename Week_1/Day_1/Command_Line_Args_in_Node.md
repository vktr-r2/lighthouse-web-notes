# Command Line Arguments in Node.js

## What are Command Line Arguments?

Command line arguments are strings of text used to pass additional information to a program when an application is run through the command line interface (CLI) of an operating system. Command line arguments typically include information used to set configuration or property values for an application.

```
$ [runtime] [script_name] [argument-1 argument-2 argument-3 ... argument-n]
```

Here runtime can be anything that executes a program/script e.g. sh, java, node, etc


## Why Use Command Line Args?

* You can pass information to an application before it starts. This is particularly useful if you want to perform large number configuration settings.
* Command line arguments are passed as strings to your program. String data types can easily be converted to other data types within an application, making the arguments very flexible.
You can pass unlimited number of arguments via the command line.
* Command line arguments are used in conjunction with scripts and batch files, which is particularly useful for automated testing.
* Flexibility: Command line arguments allow you to customize your program's behavior without modifying the code. This makes your program more flexible and easier to use
* Reusability: With command line arguments, you can reuse the same code for different purposes simply by passing different arguments. This saves time and effort in writing and maintaining multiple versions of the same code.
* Automation: Command line arguments can be used to automate tasks by passing arguments to scripts or programs that perform certain actions.
* Portability: Command line arguments can be used to make your code more portable by allowing it to work on different environments without modification.
* Integration: Command line arguments can be used to integrate your program with other tools or systems by passing arguments to other programs or scripts.

## Things to Be Aware Of

* The biggest disadvantage of passing information via the command line is that interface has steep learning curve, so it's difficult for most people to use unless they have a good deal of experience using CLI tools.
* Command line applications can be difficult to use unless you're using a desktop or laptop computer, so they're not typically used on smaller devices like phones or tablets.
